# Plant Species Image Classification with KewMNIST

This project uses the KewMNIST dataset (a plant image classification dataset) to explore deep learning in R. I trained a simple feedforward neural network using Keras and TensorFlow to classify grayscale images of plant species.

## Features

- Clean environment setup using `reticulate`
- Keras-based neural network
- Per-class accuracy analysis and visualization
- Scripted in native R with no hidden dependencies

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```r
install.packages(c("keras", "tensorflow", "reticulate"))
